### Controversy

There is some controversy around web components

- ðŸ¤” There was a "v0-spec", which has come and died
- ðŸ¤” <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="1" --> It's easy to "misuse" them.
- ðŸ¤” <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="2" --> Naming convention and naming clashes
- ðŸ¤” <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="3" --> Harder to test, since you can't easily mock away child components
- ðŸ¤” <!-- .element class="fragment" data-fragment-index="4" --> "We already have [fill in any framework]"

<!-- .element class="no-list" -->
